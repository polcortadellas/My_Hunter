# My Hunter, a graphical project

My Hunter is a simple 2D shooting game made in C with CSFML, inspired by the classic Duck Hunt. The goal is to shoot ducks as they move across the screen using your mouse. Itâ€™s a beginner-friendly game project focused on event handling, sprite animation, and time-based updates.
